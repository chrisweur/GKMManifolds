		a package for computations with GKM manifolds and moment graphs
	Description
		Text
			A GKM manifold is a variety $X$, often assumed to be smooth and complete, with an 
			action of an algebraic torus $T$ satisfying the following conditions:
			(i) $X$ is equivariantly formal with respect to the the action of $T$,
			(ii) $X$ has finitely many $T$-fixed points, and (iii) $X$ has finitely
			many one-dimensional $T$-orbits.  The data of the zero and one dimensional
			$T$-orbits of $X$ defines the moment graph of $X$, with which one can carry out
			$T$-equivariant cohomology and $T$-equivariant $K$-theory computations by
			combinatorial means.  This package provides methods for these computations
			in Macaulay2.

		"Example: generalized flag varieties"
	Description
		Text
			Generalized flag vareities are GKM manifolds.  If $G$ be a reductive complex Lie group and $P$ a 
			parabolic subgroup containing a maximal torus $T$, then the generalized flag variety $G/P$ is a GKM manifold 
			with the action of $T$.  This package allows users to create a generalized flag variety for classical Lie types 
			($A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$) as a @TO "TVariety"@ with conventions explicitly laid out as follows.

		Text
			For type $A_{n-1}$, the group $G$ is $GL_{n}$, and the torus $T$ is $diag(t_1, \ldots, t_n)$, the group of invertible diagonal matrices.

		Text
			For type $B_n$, the group $G$ is $SO_{2n+1}$, where the symmetric bilinear form on $\mathbb C^{2n+1}$ is given by the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & I_n & 0 \\ I_n & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$, and the torus $T$ is $diag(t_1, \ldots,t_n, t_1^{-1}, \ldots, t_n^{-1}, 1)$.

		Text
			For type $C_n$, the group $G$ is $Sp_{2n}$, where the alternating bilinear form on $\mathbb C^{2n}$ is given by the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -I_n \\ I_n & 0 \end{pmatrix},$ and the torus $T$ is $diag(t_1, \ldots,t_n, t_1^{-1}, \ldots, t_n^{-1})$.

		Text
			For type $D_n$, the group $G$ is $SO_{2n}$, where the symmetric bilinear form on $\mathbb C^{2n}$ is given by the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & I_n \\ I_n & 0 \end{pmatrix}$, and the torus $T$ is $diag(t_1, \ldots,t_n, t_1^{-1}, \ldots, t_n^{-1})$.

		Text
			In all the cases, the standard action of $(\mathbb C^*)^n$ on $\mathbb C^n$ is defined by $(t_1, \ldots, t_n) \cdot (x_1, \ldots, x_n) = (t_1^{-1}x_1, \ldots, t_n^{-1}x_n)$.  

		Text
			(With a Borel subgroup of $G$ fixed), let $\{w_1, \ldots, w_n\}$ be the fundamental weights, 
			ordered for each type in the same way as in Example 3.7 of [ACEP20]. 
			For a sequence $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)\in \mathbb N^n$ of nonnegative integers, 
			let $I = \{i \mid a_i \neq 0\}$ and $P_I$ the corresponding parabolic subgroup of $G$.
			Then the generalized flag variety $G/P_I$ is embedded in the irreducible representation of $G$ 
			with the highest weight $a_1w_1 + \cdots a_nw_n$.    

			These generalized flag varieties can be created as a @TO "TVariety"@ using the method 
			@TO (tGeneralizedFlagVariety, String, ZZ, List)@.  For instance, the Grassmannian $Gr(2,4)$ of
			2-dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb C^4$, embedded in $\mathbb P^5$ by the usual Plucker embedding, 
			can be created as follows.

		Example
			Gr24 = tGeneralizedFlagVariety("A",3,{2})
			peek Gr24

		Text
			The moment graph of $Gr(2,4)$ is the 1-skeleton of the hypersimplex $\Delta(2,4)$, a.k.a. the octahedron.

		Example
			G = momentGraph Gr24
			underlyingGraph G

		Text
			The $O(1)$ line bundle on $Gr(2,4)$ via its Plucker embedding can be accessed as follows, and 
			its Lefschetz trace (a.k.a. T-equivariant Euler characteristic) is a Laurent polynomial in 
			the character ring of the torus $T$, whose terms correspond to be weights of the second
			exterior power of the standard representation of $GL_4$.

		Example
			O1 = ampleTKClass Gr24 --the O(1) bundle on Gr24 via its Plucker embedding
			tChi O1

		Text
			If $Gr(2,4)$ is embedded differently, say by $O(2)$ line bundle instead, the Lefschetz trace changes 
			accordingly, and its coefficients record the multiplicities of the associated weight spaces in the second
			symmetric power of the second exterior power of the standard representation of $GL_4$.

		Example
			tChi (O1^2)

		Text
			The following example features the isotropic Grassmannian $SpGr(2,4)$ consisting of 
			2-dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb C^4$ that are isotropic with respect to the standard alternating form.
			Its moment graph is the a complete graph on 4 vertices.

		Example
			SpGr24 = tGeneralizedFlagVariety("C",2,{2})
			peek SpGr24
			underlyingGraph momentGraph SpGr24
			tChi ampleTKClass SpGr24
