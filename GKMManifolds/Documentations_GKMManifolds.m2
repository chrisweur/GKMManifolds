		GKMManifolds
	Headline
		a package for computations with GKM manifolds and moment graphs
	Description
		Text
			A GKM manifold is a variety $X$, often assumed to be smooth and complete, with an 
			action of an algebraic torus $T$ satisfying the following conditions:
			(i) $X$ is equivariantly formal with respect to the the action of $T$,
			(ii) $X$ has finitely many $T$-fixed points, and (iii) $X$ has finitely
			many one-dimensional $T$-orbits.  The data of the zero and one dimensional
			$T$-orbits of $X$ defines the moment graph of $X$, with which one can carry out
			$T$-equivariant cohomology and $T$-equivariant $K$-theory computations by
			combinatorial means.  This package provides methods for these computations
			in Macaulay2.

		"Example: generalized flag varieties"
	Description
		Text
			Generalized flag vareities are GKM manifolds.  If $G$ be a reductive complex Lie group and $P$ a 
			parabolic subgroup containing a maximal torus $T$, then the generalized flag variety $G/P$ is a GKM manifold 
			with the action of $T$.  This package allows users to create a generalized flag variety for classical Lie types 
			($A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$) as a @TO "TVariety"@ with conventions explicitly laid out as follows.

		Text
			For type $A_{n-1}$, the group $G$ is $GL_{n}$, and the torus $T$ is $diag(t_1, \ldots, t_n)$, the group of invertible diagonal matrices.

		Text
			For type $B_n$, the group $G$ is $SO_{2n+1}$, where we set the standard symmetric bilinear form on $\mathbb C^{2n+1}$ 
			to be is given by the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & I_n & 0 \\ I_n & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$, and the torus $T$ is $diag(t_1, \ldots,t_n, t_1^{-1}, \ldots, t_n^{-1}, 1)$.

		Text
			For type $C_n$, the group $G$ is $Sp_{2n}$, where we set the standard the alternating bilinear form on $\mathbb C^{2n}$ 
			to be given by the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -I_n \\ I_n & 0 \end{pmatrix},$ and the torus $T$ is 
			$diag(t_1, \ldots,t_n, t_1^{-1}, \ldots, t_n^{-1})$.

		Text
			For type $D_n$, the group $G$ is $SO_{2n}$, where the symmetric bilinear form on $\mathbb C^{2n}$ is given by the matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & I_n \\ I_n & 0 \end{pmatrix}$, and the torus $T$ is $diag(t_1, \ldots,t_n, t_1^{-1}, \ldots, t_n^{-1})$.

		Text
			In all the cases, the standard action of $(\mathbb C^*)^n$ on $\mathbb C^n$ is defined by $(t_1, \ldots, t_n) \cdot (x_1, \ldots, x_n) = (t_1^{-1}x_1, \ldots, t_n^{-1}x_n)$.  

		Text
			(With a Borel subgroup of $G$ fixed), let $\{w_1, \ldots, w_n\}$ be the fundamental weights, 
			ordered for each type in the same way as in Example 3.7 of [ACEP20]. 
			For a sequence $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)\in \mathbb N^n$ of nonnegative integers, 
			let $I = \{i \mid a_i \neq 0\}$ and $P_I$ the corresponding parabolic subgroup of $G$.
			Then the generalized flag variety $G/P_I$ is embedded in the irreducible representation of $G$ 
			with the highest weight $a_1w_1 + \cdots a_nw_n$.    
			These generalized flag varieties can be created as a @TO "TVariety"@ using the method 
			@TO tGeneralizedFlagVariety@.  For instance, the Grassmannian $Gr(2,4)$ of
			2-dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb C^4$, embedded in $\mathbb P^5$ by the usual Plucker embedding, 
			can be created as follows.

		Example
			Gr24 = tGeneralizedFlagVariety("A",3,{2})
			peek Gr24

		Text
			The @TO MomentGraph@ of $Gr(2,4)$ is the 1-skeleton of the hypersimplex $\Delta(2,4)$, a.k.a. the octahedron.

		Example
			G = momentGraph Gr24
			underlyingGraph G

		Text
			The $O(1)$ line bundle on $Gr(2,4)$ via its Plucker embedding can be accessed by @TO ampleTKClass@.
			The method @TO (tChi, TKClass)@ computes its Lefschetz trace (a.k.a. T-equivariant Euler characteristic),
			which in this case is the Laurent polynomial in the character ring of the torus $T$ 
			whose terms correspond to be weights of the second exterior power of the standard representation of $GL_4$.

		Example
			O1 = ampleTKClass Gr24 --the O(1) bundle on Gr24 via its Plucker embedding
			tChi O1

		Text
			If $Gr(2,4)$ is embedded differently, say by $O(2)$ line bundle instead, the Lefschetz trace changes 
			accordingly, and its coefficients record the multiplicities of the associated weight spaces in the second
			symmetric power of the second exterior power of the standard representation of $GL_4$.

		Example
			tChi (O1^2)

		Text
			The Schubert decomposition of $Gr(2,4)$, and more generally the Bruhat decomposition of $G/P$, can be accessed 
			by the method @TO (bruhatOrder, TVariety)@, which outputs the poset of the Bruhat order.  Moreover, the Schubert
			varieties can be created via the method @TO tGeneralizedSchubertVariety@.

		Example
			P1 =  bruhatOrder Gr24
			Sch = tGeneralizedSchubertVariety(Gr24,{set{1,2}})
			P2 = bruhatOrder Sch
			--{P1,P2}/displayPoset --to view the posets in pdf

		Text
			The "forgetful" map from the full flag variety $Fl(4)$ of full flags in $\mathbb C^4$ to $Gr(2,4)$, 
			given by forgetting the subpsaces in the flag except for the 2-dimensional one, and be created as 
			a @TO TMap@ by the method @TO tFlagMap@.

		Example
			Fl4 = tGeneralizedFlagVariety("A",3,{1,2,3},Gr24.charRing) --Fl(4) with the torus having the same character ring as Gr24
			f = tFlagMap(Fl4,Gr24)
			Fl4 === f.source and Gr24 === f.target
			(trivialTKClass Gr24) === (pushforward f)(trivialTKClass Fl4)

		Text
			The (derived) pushforward of the structure sheaf of $Fl(4)$ is the structure sheaf of $Gr(2,4)$ since the higher direct images vanish under the forgetful map.

		Example
			(trivialTKClass Gr24) === (pushforward f)(trivialTKClass Fl4)

		Text
			The following example features the isotropic Grassmannian $SpGr(2,6)$ consisting of 
			2-dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb C^6$ that are isotropic with respect to the standard alternating form.
			The vertices of its moment graph can be considered as the vertices of the cuboctahedron.

		Example
			SpGr26 = tGeneralizedFlagVariety("C",3,{2})
			peek SpGr26
			momentGraph SpGr26

		Text
			The second fundamental representation of $Sp_{6}$ is 14-dimensional with 12 extremal weights.

		Example
			tChi ampleTKClass SpGr26

		Text
			The following example features the isotropic Grassmannian $OGr(2,5)$ consisting of
			3-dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb C^5$ that are isotropic with respect to the standard symmetric form.
			Its moment graph is the a complete graph on 4 vertices.
			Note that Spin groups and their representations are not implemented, so for the type $B_n$ the coefficient
			$a_n$ need be a multiple of 2.

		Example
			OGr25 = tGeneralizedFlagVariety("B",2,{2,2}) --inputing {2} instead of {2,2} results in error: spin groups not implemented yet
			peek OGr25
			tChi ampleTKClass OGr25

		    	R = ZZ[T_0..T_3]
		    	X = tGeneralizedFlagVariety("A",3,{1,2,3},R)
			Y = tGeneralizedFlagVariety("A",3,{2,3},R)
			Z = tGeneralizedFlagVariety("A",3,{3},R)
			f = tFlagMap(X,Y); --the projection of Fl(1,2,3;4) onto Gr(2,3;4)
			g = tFlagMap(Y,Z); --the projection of Fl(2,3;3) onto Gr(3;4)
			try compose(g,f)

	Description
		Text
			This method creates a @TO TMap@ given a T-Variety $X$, a T-variety $Y$,
			and a list @TT "L"@ of pairs (x,y) where x and y are members of @TT "X.points"@ and @TT "Y.points"@ (respectively),
			indicating that the T-fixed point x of X is sent to the T-fixed point y of Y under the map.

			The following describes the projection from the third Hizerbruch surface to the projective 
			line.
			
		Example
		    	R = ZZ[T_0,T_1]
			F3 = tVariety(hirzebruchSurface 3,R);
			PP1 = tProjectiveSpace(1,R);
			L = {({0,1},set {0}), ({0,3}, set{0}), ({1,2}, set{1}), ({2,3}, set{1})};
			f = tMap(F3,PP1,L)
	Caveat
		This does not check that the morphism is well defined. In particular, it does not
		verify that the map on T-fixed points is induced by a morphism of T-varieties.
