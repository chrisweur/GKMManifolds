TODO LIST


CHECK

* Product: if X,Y both have moment graphs, then should also compute the moment graph for the product.  please check my code; this was trickier than first imagined.

* isWellDefined(TKClass): is there any better way to test for "equals 0 mod 1 - T^lambda"?  Because M2 does not do fraction rings over Laurent rings, I had to do the "toFraction" trick

* the generalized flag variety command (many many checks!).  In doing so, should verify the claims about the (even) orthogonal Grassmannians.  For example is SOGr(n,2n) disconnected?!? Also, need check the T-fixed points and charts for the SOGr(n-1,2n) case as well.

* also, why is the generalized flag variety command soooooo slow? is there a way to speed it up?

* the generalized Schubert variety command (again, need many checks!)

*tChi for the T-equivariant Euler characteristic (i.e. the Lefschetz trace <-- maybe call it that?)


MAKE

* maps between generalized flag varieties, just like the usual one.

* torus-orbit closure as a TKClass for generalized flag varieties.

(for both functions above, the function "lieType" may have to be used)



MISC

* import K-Tutte for flag matroid stuff

opt. import Braden stuff

opt. add functionalities from "How is a graph like a manifold?"
