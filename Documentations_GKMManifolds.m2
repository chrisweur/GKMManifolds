		GKMManifolds
	Headline
		a package for computations with GKM manifolds and moment graphs
	Description
		Text
			A GKM manifold is a variety X, often assumed smooth and complete, with an 
			action of an algebraic torus T satisfying the following conditions:
			(i) X is equivariantly formal with respect to the the action of T,
			(ii) X has finitely many T-fixed points, and (iii) X has finitely
			many one-dimensional T-orbits.  The data of the zero and one dimensional
			T-orbits of X defines a moment graph, with which one can carry out
			T-equivariant cohomology and T-equivariant K-theory computations by
			combinatorial means.  This package provides methods for these computations
			in Macaulay2.
